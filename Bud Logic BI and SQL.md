The prioritization of Primary, Secondary, and Fallback budget categories in the logic is achieved using the IF-ELSEIF-ELSE conditional structure. Hereâ€™s how it works step-by-step:

Step 1: Primary Budget Categories (vma, cma)
Condition:
sql
Copy
Edit
WHEN SUM(vma) > 0 AND SUM(cma) > 0
or in DAX:
DAX
Copy
Edit
IF(SUM(vma) > 0 && SUM(cma) > 0, ...)
This checks if both vma (variable major allocation) and cma (constant major allocation) are greater than 0.
If true, these columns are prioritized because they might represent the most significant or recent budget allocations.
The formula immediately calculates the sum of vma and cma, divides it by 10,000, and stops further evaluation.
This short-circuit evaluation ensures other conditions are skipped when primary conditions are satisfied.
Step 2: Secondary Budget Categories (vre, cre)
Condition:
sql
Copy
Edit
WHEN SUM(vre) > 0 AND SUM(cre) > 0
or in DAX:
DAX
Copy
Edit
IF(SUM(vre) > 0 && SUM(cre) > 0, ...)
If Primary conditions are not met, the query checks whether both vre (variable revenue allocation) and cre (constant revenue allocation) are greater than 0.
This acts as a backup to the primary budget, potentially representing revenue allocations.
If the condition is true, it calculates the sum of vre and cre, divides by 10,000, and stops further evaluation.
Step 3: Fallback Budget Categories (vbe, cbe)
Condition:
sql
Copy
Edit
ELSE (SUM(vbe) + SUM(cbe)) / 10000
or in DAX:
DAX
Copy
Edit
ELSE (SUM(vbe) + SUM(cbe)) / 10000
If neither the Primary nor the Secondary conditions are satisfied (i.e., their sums are 0 or negative), the Fallback budget is used.
This calculates the sum of vbe (variable base allocation) and cbe (constant base allocation) as a last resort to ensure the result is always valid.
It acts as a default safety net.
Key Features of the Prioritization Logic:
Hierarchical Evaluation:

The logic is sequential, meaning the query evaluates Primary, then Secondary, and finally Fallback categories in order of importance.
Once a condition is satisfied, it stops checking further conditions (short-circuiting).
Significance-Based Prioritization:

Primary (vma, cma): Represents the most critical or current allocations, so these are used first if available.
Secondary (vre, cre): Serves as a backup, likely less significant than the primary allocations.
Fallback (vbe, cbe): Ensures the logic returns a value even when primary and secondary data are unavailable.
Failsafe Mechanism:

The ELSE clause ensures that even if all vma, cma, vre, and cre are zero or invalid, a meaningful value is still computed using vbe and cbe.
How This Works in IF-ELSEIF-ELSE Logic:
In programming, the conditional structure would look like this:
pseudo
Copy
Edit
IF (SUM(vma) > 0 AND SUM(cma) > 0) {
    // Calculate Primary Budget
    Result = (SUM(vma) + SUM(cma)) / 10000;
} ELSE IF (SUM(vre) > 0 AND SUM(cre) > 0) {
    // Calculate Secondary Budget
    Result = (SUM(vre) + SUM(cre)) / 10000;
} ELSE {
    // Calculate Fallback Budget
    Result = (SUM(vbe) + SUM(cbe)) / 10000;
}
The logic evaluates each condition in sequence.
It stops as soon as a condition is met, ensuring the highest-priority data is used.
Real-Life Implications:
This approach is helpful in scenarios where different budget components (e.g., allocations and revenues) might be incomplete or unavailable. By layering the logic:
Primary categories are always preferred if available.
Secondary categories are a backup if primary data is missing.
Fallback categories guarantee thereâ€™s no missing value in the final result.
